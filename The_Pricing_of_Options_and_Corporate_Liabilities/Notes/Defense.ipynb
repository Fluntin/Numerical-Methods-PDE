    "Applying the Central Limit Theorem: to analyse stock price fluctuations suggests that stock price changes (returns) may approximate a normal distribution under certain conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Independence**: The changes in stock prices or returns must be independent of each other. This means that the return from one period does not influence the return in another period.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Identically Distributed**: The returns should be identically distributed; that is, they should all come from the same probability distribution. This doesnâ€™t mean the distribution must be normal, only that all returns share the same distributional characteristics.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Sufficiently Large Sample Size**: The CLT is most effective when applied to a large number of returns. As the sample size increases, the distribution of the sample mean of these returns will approach a normal distribution, regardless of the underlying distribution of the individual returns.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **No Outliers**: Extreme values or outliers in the data can affect the normality of the distribution. For the CLT to hold, the influence of extreme values should be minimal, which often assumes that the underlying distributions do not have heavy tails.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Finite Variance**: The random variables (in this case, stock returns) should have a finite variance. If the variance is infinite or undefined, the CLT may not apply, which is a concern in financial data known for \"fat tails\" that violate this assumption.\n",
    "\n",
    "These conditions are idealized and, in real-world financial markets, may not always hold perfectly. For instance, market returns can show periods of volatility clustering where variances are not stable, or returns might be influenced by past returns (contradicting independence). Hence, while the CLT provides a useful framework for theoretical analysis, its practical application in finance must often be supplemented with additional financial modeling techniques to account for these complexities."
