    "### 1.1Introduction and Background\n",
    "\n",
    "To better understand this report, it is crucial to understand what an option contract is and what are its basic features. When one buys an option contract, they are purchasing a right but not an obligation to purchase (call option) or sell (put option) an asset at a certain price (strike price) by a certain date (maturity date). The purchaser of the option can choose what they prefer as the strike price and maturity date, and the price of the contract will adjust accordingly. When the maturity date of a call option hits, if the underlying asset's price is at or above the strike price (at-the-money (ATM), in-the-money (ITM)), the purchaser of the call option can choose to exercise the contract and purchase the underlying asset at the strike price but if the underlying asset's price is below the strike price (Out-of-the-money (OTM)), the contract expires worthless because it does not make sense to exercise. Similarly, when the maturity date of a put option hits, if the underlying asset's price is at or below the strike price (ATM, ITM), the purchaser of the put option can choose to exercise the contract and sell the underlying asset at the strike price, but the contract expires worthless if the asset's price is above the strike price (OTM).\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of this project was to create and compare the accuracy of multiple options pricing models and evaluate its accuracy based on comparisons of finite element models to a finite difference model and a theoretical solution. There were three models in total, two finite element models and one finite difference model.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Black-Scholes partial differential equation (PDE) is an equation that is used to determine options contract pricing, which is often used in the stock market. Specifically, this PDE is most commonly used for European option contracts as they cannot be exercised prior to the maturity date, while American options can be exercised prior to maturity. Mathematical adjustments to the Black-Scholes PDE must be made to account for American options. This paper focuses on European options and neglects the existence of the option to exercise contracts early. Equation 1 below is the most common form of the Black-Scholes PDE, and it resembles a general nonsteady state advection-diffusion PDE.\n",

    "Where $V$ represents the value of the option contract (\\$), $t$ represents the time in years since option purchase. $0 \\leq t \\leq T$ where $T$ is the time in years at contract maturity, $S$ represents the stock price of the asset underlying the option contract (\\$), $\\sigma$ represents the implied volatility of the option contract, and $r$ represents the risk-free interest rate, typically taken as the 10-year treasury bond yield as a yearly interest rate.\n",
    "\n",
    "A few of the biggest weaknesses of the Black-Scholes PDE are that it does not account for early exercising of contracts, as explained above, and it assumes that implied volatility and risk-free interest rate are constant, which they are not. Typically, the interest rate does not fluctuate significantly, but it is not uncommon for implied volatility to greatly fluctuate from hour to hour. Therefore, in practice, the resulting finite difference or finite element model must be run periodically to update itself.\n",
    "\n",
    "Other limitations of the Black-Scholes Model as outlined by Investopedia are that they assume continuous trading, no broker fees or bid/ask pricing spreads, it assumes that stock prices follow\n",
    "a lognormal pattern (i.e. geometric Brownian motion) which ignores large price swings, it assumes no dividends are paid out, and it assumes the market is run by ideal banks, meaning there are no arbitrage opportunities due to pricing discrepancies (Seth, 2022).\n",
    "\n",
    "The finite element (FE) method that was used was a 1D application of the Galerkin Method of Weighted Residuals (GMWR) in the price dimension, followed by a 1D application of the Crank-Nicolson Method (CNM) in the temporal dimension."

However, the derivation of the model follows the same logic and sequences as the FE model using equation 9 (Diffusion/Heat PDE). Assuming that the implementation of the FE model using the Heat PDE is correct, the errors of the FE model using the Advection-Diffusion PDE should not be a fundamental flaw in logic and is likely caused by human errors or typos in the derivation or code. Further analysis from this point will neglect the FE model using the Advection-Diffusion PDE as it is incorrect.\n",

    "\n",
    "It was considered unusual that the Heat FE model was less accurate than the finite difference model, as FE models are usually more accurate that finite difference models at the cost of higher computation time. Two procedures were completed to act as sanity checks to ensure that the Heat FE model was implemented correctly.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first sanity check was to apply the same GMWR plus CNM to the concrete chloride concentration problem in assignment 3 to see if the resulting model would converge to the exact solution. Since the governing PDE for the Heat FE model heavily resembled the governing PDE for the concrete chloride concentration problem, the derivation and code implementation of the concrete chloride concentration problem was near identical to the Heat FE model. The only differences between the two problems were that the boundary conditions were different from each other, and the coefficient in front of the double derivative with respect to the space dimension were different. See Appendix B page 7 for the detailed derivation of the concrete chloride concentration FE model using GMWR and CNM, and Appendix A for the full MATLAB script that creates the concrete chloride concentration FE model and note its high resemblance to the derivation and MATLAB script of the Heat FE model.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Since the FE model for the concrete chloride concentration problem converged to the exact theoretical solution using GMWR and CNM, it was concluded that this model was implemented correctly, and by extension, the Heat FE model for Black-Scholes PDE was also implemented correctly.\n",
    "\n",
    "The second sanity check was to compare my results with other scholarly articles that also applied GMWR and CNM to the Black-Scholes equation. Most other papers that created options pricing models only used finite difference methods because the granularity of options pricing models are coarse enough that discrete solutions are usually sufficient, so it was difficult to find comparable articles. One particular article from the Department of Applied Mathematics at the University of Dhaka, Bangladesh decided to perform the same comparison with one finite difference model and one finite element model on the Black-Scholes equation. For their finite difference model, they applied the Du Fort-Frankel finite difference method, which is a slightly different finite difference scheme than the CNM. For their finite element model, they applied GMWR plus CNM to the advection-diffusion version of the Black-Scholes PDE (Shorif Hossan et al., 2020). As a result, the article used the very similar methods compared to this project, different paths to the same destination. The four figures below highlight the results of their paper (Shorif Hossan et al., 2020).\n",
    "\n",
    "Where the paper also concluded that the results obtained from the finite difference model were better than the results obtained by the finite element model, and that the finite element model tends to deviate from the solution found using equation 12 at certain locations (Shorif Hossan et al., 2020). However, this paper did not suggest any reasons as to why this might have occurred.\n",
    "\n",
    "The second sanity check supported the Heat FE model as they both concluded that the finite difference model was superior to the finite element model, but it also reaffirms that the Advection-Diffusion FE model was flawed as their paper implemented their FE model using the Advection-Diffusion version of the Black-Scholes PDE with different results than this project."

    "### 4.1 Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "To determine European option pricing, numerical models for the Black-Scholes PDE were created using finite difference and finite element methods. The resulting models account for both call option pricing and put option pricing because they are distinguished only by their boundary conditions. This report focused mainly on call option pricing. However, Black-Scholes PDE does not account for American options as it does not consider the effects of having the ability to exercise in-the-money options prior to maturity.\n",
    "\n",
    "Three options pricing models were created and compared with each other and compared with a theoretical Black-Scholes solution as shown in equation 12. One model using strictly finite difference methods with central differencing in the stock price dimension, and Crank-Nicolson Method in the time dimension. The other two models were created using a combination of finite element and finite difference methods, where Galerkin Method of Weighted Residuals was applied in the stock price dimension and Crank-Nicolson Method was applied in the time dimension. The difference between the two finite element models were that one was created using the classical Black-Scholes PDE, resembling an Advection-Diffusion PDE, and the other was created using a transformed Black-Scholes PDE with transformed boundary conditions, resembling a Heat/Diffusion PDE.\n",
    "\n",
    "It was concluded that the finite element model created using the Advection-Diffusion PDE was not flawed in its derivation logic but flawed with potential human errors or typos either in the code or the derivation, and the flaw(s) have yet to be found. For some unknown reason, the finite difference model was more accurate than the Heat PDE finite element model when compared to equation 12. This apparent relationship was consistent with another article from the University of Dhaka that also attempted a very similar comparison. As a result, it was concluded that the finite difference model and the finite element model created using the Heat PDE were implemented correctly despite the oddity in the finite element model being less accurate than the finite difference model.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since the finite difference model is simpler to derive, simpler to implement onto a program, requires less computation time to run, and is more accurate than the finite element model using GMWR and Crank-Nicolson Method, a finite difference Black-Scholes model is recommended over a finite element Black-Scholes model in practical applications."
