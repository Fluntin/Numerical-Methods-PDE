    "Show that this also applies to the symplectic Euler method. Molecular dynamics is used, for example, in materials science to determine material properties such as diffusion constant, conductivity, and viscosity from fundamental principles and in biochemistry to study the movement of proteins. Here, $q$ is a vector in $\\mathbb{R}^{3 N}$ that indicates the positions of $N$ atoms, and $f$ are the forces acting on the atoms. In molecular dynamics, one is interested in approximating so-called observables $\\lim _{T \\rightarrow \\infty} \\int_0^T g(q(t)) d t / T$ for given functions $g$, for example, the potential energy $g(q)=V(q)$, where $V^{\\prime}(q)=f(q)$.\n",
