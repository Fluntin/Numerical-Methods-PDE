    "1. **Forward Euler**\n",
    "We observed that energy increases with any level of eccentricity. For lower eccentricities, individual orbits around the central body are clearly visible on the energy graph. However, at higher eccentricities, energy spikes sharply and then stabilizes. This happens because the orbiting body quickly gains too much energy, moving away from the central body, causing the energy related to $q$ to become almost negligible. Thus, the interaction between the bodies weakens, and $p$ remains almost constant, leading to minimal energy changes later on. This is evident in Figure 1, especially in parts where eccentricity is $0.5$ and  $0.75$, where the bodies move at a constant speed and distance themselves from the central body.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Backward Euler** \n",
    "Using the Backward Euler method, we clearly saw energy decrease. To illustrate this, we adjusted the timestep count ($N$) for various eccentricities and chose a smaller timestep size compared to the Forward Euler method. It's important to note that this energy decrease is only an initial phase. If the simulation continues beyond the point where the magnitude of $q$ becomes very small, the magnitude of $p$ will suddenly increase, propelling the body away and causing a sharp increase in energy. This phenomenon is particularly noticeable in simulations where eccentricity is around $0.5$, timestep is relativley small $<10^{-3}$, and $N$ is sufficiently large $>5000$. The orbit initially spirals inward before being ejected outward, at which point energy gradually declines before spiking suddenly as the body is ejected, eventually stabilizing at a higher level than before.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Implicit Midpoint Method**\n",
    "We observed that the energy varies at a predictable rate, yet remains nearly constant, with only negligible differences. This aligns well with the fact that, upon plotting the trajectories post-simulation, the paths using the Implicit Midpoint Method more closely resemble elliptical orbits compared to the results from the other three methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Symplectic Euler** \n",
    "With the Symplectic Euler method, we noticed that energy neither decreases nor increases steadily. The energy variations are several orders of magnitude greater than those observed with the Implicit Midpoint Method, yet they remain largely negligible, especially for nearly circular orbits."
