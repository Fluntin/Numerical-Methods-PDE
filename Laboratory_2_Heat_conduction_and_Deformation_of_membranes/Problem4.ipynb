    "The maximum principle, as applied to the function $ u(x) = \\frac{\\ln (|x|)}{\\ln (\\epsilon)} $ in this problem, provides important insights into the behavior of $ u $, which represents the height of the tent fabric:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Boundary Value Behavior and Maxima/Minima**:\n",
    "  - The function $ u $ reaches its maximum and minimum values on the boundary of the domain $ \\Omega_\\epsilon \\backslash \\partial \\Omega_\\epsilon $, which is open, connected, and bounded.\n",
    "  - Specifically, $ u(x) = 0 $ for all $ x $ such that $ |x| = 1 $, which represents the outer boundary.\n",
    "  - On the inner boundary, where $ |x| = \\epsilon $, $ u(x) = 1 $.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Behavior Inside the Domain**: \n",
    "  - For points within the domain, where $ |x| $ lies between $\\epsilon$ and 1, $ u(x) $ takes values between 0 and 1. This is due to the logarithmic nature of $ u(x) $, ensuring that it remains within these bounds inside the tent's domain.\n",
    "  - The logarithms of $ |x| $ and $ \\epsilon $ share the same sign, but the absolute value of the logarithm of $ \\epsilon $ is greater than that of $ |x| $, which keeps $ u(x) $ within the range of 0 to 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Conclusion and Implications**:\n",
    "  - According to the maximum principle, the height of the tent fabric $ u $ varies smoothly from 1 at the center to 0 at the edge, adhering to the boundary conditions.\n",
    "  - In the limit case as $ \\epsilon \\rightarrow 0^+ $, the boundary becomes the set of points where $ |x| = 1 $. Here, the maximum principle still applies, but the maximum and minimum values of $ u $ are both 0, resulting in the height of the tent fabric being consistently zero. This scenario contrasts the conditions in $ V_\\epsilon $, demonstrating a limitation in the model as $ \\epsilon $ approaches zero.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, the maximum principle reveals that the height of the tent fabric $ u $ is determined by its values at the boundary of the domain, smoothly transitioning between these values within the domain, and underscores the limitations of the model in the extreme case as $ \\epsilon $ approaches zero."
