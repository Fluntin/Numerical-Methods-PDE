    "1. **Selection of Basis Functions**:\n",
    "   - The first step in FEM is to choose appropriate basis functions. For our problem, we use piecewise linear functions, known as $\\varphi_i$. These functions are defined such that $\\varphi_i(j) = \\delta_{ij}$, where $\\delta_{ij}$ is the Kronecker delta function. This choice simplifies the computation while adequately representing the solution's variation along the rod.\n",

    "\n",
    "3. **Assembly of the System Matrix and Load Vector**:\n",
    "   - In FEM, the variational formulation is translated into a system of linear equations. This involves constructing the system matrix $\\tilde{A}$ and the load vector $\\tilde{L}$. The elements of $\\tilde{A}$ and $\\tilde{L}$ are determined by the functions $A(\\varphi_j, \\varphi_i)$ and $L(\\varphi_j)$, respectively. These functions incorporate the rod's varying thermal conductivity, the heat source, and the boundary conditions.\n",

The Dirichlet boundary condition (temperature fixed at one end) is applied by modifying specific entries in the system matrix and load vector. This ensures that the solution adheres to the prescribed temperature at one end of the rod.\n",

The method ensures that the integral of polynomial functions up to a certain degree can be computed exactly.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Simplifying the Integration Process**:\n",
    "   - By applying Gaussian Quadrature, the complex task of evaluating these integrals is simplified. The method transforms the integrals into a sum over the chosen Gauss points, significantly reducing computational complexity.\n",
