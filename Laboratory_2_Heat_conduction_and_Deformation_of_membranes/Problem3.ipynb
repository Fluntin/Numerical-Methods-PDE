    "1. **Exact Solutions for Both Cases:**\n",
    "   - **Case 1:** $ f_1(x) = 0, a_1(x) = 1 + x $\n",
    "     - The exact solution: $ u_1(x) = \\ln(1 + x) $.\n",
    "   - **Case 2:** $ f_2(x) = e^x, a_2(x) = e^x $\n",
    "     - The exact solution: $ u_2(x) = (1 + e)(1 - e^{-x}) - x $.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Comparison Using Finite Element Method (FEM):**\n",
    "\n",
    "   - We should compare FEM solutions are compared with the exact solutions for different numbers of elements.\n",
    "\n",
    "   - Visual inspection of the solution curves using both one-point and two-point Gaussian quadrature shows no noticeable difference in the appearance of the graphs for either set of boundary conditions. \n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Computational Complexity:**\n",
    "\n",
    "   - The choice between one-point and two-point Gaussian quadrature does not significantly affect the computational complexity.\n",
    "\n",
    "   - Approximately the same number of elements are needed in both methods, and the additional function evaluations in the two-point method are relatively inexpensive.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Energy Norm:**\n",
    "\n",
    "   - The energy norm is calculated as:\n",
    "    $$ \\|v\\|_V = \\sqrt{\\int_0^1 a(x)(v'(x))^2 dx} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "   - The residuals of the energy norm are very similar between the one-point and two-point methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "   - Method used for calculating the energy norm is intentionally approximate, balancing purpose and implementation complexity.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Quantitative Analysis:**\n",
    "\n",
    "   - For both function sets, the energy norm residuals (denoted as $ \\rho $) were calculated for various element counts.\n",
    "\n",
    "   - For the first set, fewer elements were needed to achieve a certain $ \\rho $ compared to the second set. For instance, $ n = 3 $ for $ \\rho < 0.6 $, while for the second set, $ n = 20 $ was needed for the same $ \\rho $.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Conclusion:**\n",
    "\n",
    "   - While there is no significant difference in efficiency between the one-point and two-point methods, the second set of functions consistently requires a finer discretization (more elements) for the same level of accuracy.\n",
    "   \n",
    "   - This observation is consistent across various levels of the energy norm residuals."
